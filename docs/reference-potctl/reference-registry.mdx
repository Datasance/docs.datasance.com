# Registry YAML Specification

`potctl` allows users to manage a Controller's list of registries. To learn more about registries, please see [microservice registry documentation](../applications/microservice-registry-catalog).

The registry has a very simple definition

  url: registry.hub.docker.com # This will create a registry that can download your private docker hub images
  username: john
  password: q1u45ic9kst563art
  email: user@domain.com
  requiresCert: false
  certificate: ''
```
