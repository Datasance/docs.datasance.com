# Control Plane YAML Specification

`potctl` allows users to deploy Edge Compute Networks ('ECNs'). The various resources which constitute an ECN are specified within YAML files for potctl to consume.


:::warning[Trying to use potctl v1.3.4 with an older ECN?]
  <p>You can connect to an older ECN with potctl +v1.3.0 for view-only purposes. If you would like full control over the ECN with potctl +v1.3.0, you should delete the ECN with your older potctl and then redeploy with potctl +v1.3.0 .</p>

## Kubernetes Control Plane

The Kubernetes Control Plane specifies all the resources required to deploy the ioFog Control Plane on a Kubernetes cluster.

An entire ECN can be specified within a single YAML file.

Multiple resources can be incorporated into a single YAML file using `---` as a separator.
