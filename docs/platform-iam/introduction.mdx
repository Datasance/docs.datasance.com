# Introduction

Datasance PoT integrates Keycloak as its identity and access management (IAM) solution to provide secure authentication and authorization across the platform. By leveraging Keycloak, PoT ensures a centralized and scalable approach to manage user identities, roles, and permissions. This integration enables robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for users, ensuring secure access to critical edge infrastructure and applications. With Keycloak, Datasance PoT supports Single Sign-On (SSO) and identity federation, streamlining user management while enhancing security, making it an ideal solution for enterprises operating in dynamic and distributed environments.

## Roles and permissions

By default preconfigured Datasance PoT realm comes with below Realm level roles:
- pot-Admin
- pot-SRE
- pot-Developer
- pot-Viewer

By default preconfigured Datasance PoT realm comes with  two client `pot-controller` and `ecn-viewer`. 
`ecn-viewer`client comes with `Standard Flow` , `pot-controller` client comes with `Direct access grants` and `Service accounts roles`

Both `pot-controller` and `ecn-viewer` client has tree roles: `SRE`, `Developer` and `Viewer`

Below you can find how realm Level roles are associated with Client level roles. 

| Realm Role | pot-controller | ecn-viewer |
|------------| --------------| ------------|
| pot-Admin | SRE | SRE |
| pot-SRE | SRE | SRE |
| pot-Developer | Developer | Developer |
| pot-Viewer | Viewer | Viewer |

Only users with `pot-Admin` roles can access Keycloak console and add or remove users, configure realm settings.

:::warning[Don't change client level roles]
It is important to note that you have never change the client level roles as `Controller`'s REST-API endpoints protected against user's associated client level roles.
::: 

- `SRE`'s can deploy, manage and configure both Agents, System Applications, Applications and Microservices.
- `Developer`'s can deploy, manage and configure Applications and Microservices.
- `Viewer`'s can only view the cluster resources.

By default users with `Developer` and `Viewer` roles need to configure 2FA. If you want to force `SRE`'s to 2FA you need to configure settings on `browser dynamic otp` flow on Authentication section.
