# Move and Rename Microservices

## Move Microservices

We can move a deployed Microservice between Agents within the same potctl Namespace. Remember that a Namespace corresponds to a single Edge Compute Network.

If we wanted to move `msvc-1` to `agent-2` we could run:

```bash
potctl move microservice msvc-1 agent-2
```

## Rename Microservices

We can change Microservice names after they have been deployed.

If we wanted to rename `msvc-1` to `new-msvc-1` we could run:

```plain
potctl rename msvc-1 new-msvc-1
```

Microservice names must be unique within a single Namespace. The above command would fail if `new-msvc-1` already existed in the corresponding Namespace.
