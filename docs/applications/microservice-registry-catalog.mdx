# Microservice Registry and Catalog Management

During the [Quickstart](../getting-started/quick-start-local) and the [tutorial](../tutorial/introduction), we specified images to be used for each microservice, for each type of Agent.

That was nice and easy, but what if we need to deploy the same code on a lot of Agents? We would need to specify the images for each Microservice. Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to specify the images to be used for each type of Agent once and then reuse this configuration? That's where the Controller Microservice catalog comes into play!

Each ioFog Controller comes with a built-in microservice catalog. You can see the list of preconfigured Microservices images using `potctl`:

```bash
potctl get catalog
```

```console
NAMESPACE
default

ID		NAME		DESCRIPTION									REGISTRY	X86		                        ARM					
1		NATs		NATs server microservice for Datasance PoT					remote		ghcr.io/datasance/nats:latest		ghcr.io/datasance/nats:latest		
4		EdgeGuard	Security and monitoring component for edge devices running ioFog Agents.	remote		ghcr.io/datasance/edge-guard:latest	ghcr.io/datasance/edge-guard:latest	

```

Instead of specifying the images for each Agent type, we can refer to catalog ID in your Microservice specification. We can see that there is a `Hello Web Demo` catalog item that is configured with the `iofog/hello-web` image for x86 Agents, and `iofog/hello-web-arm` for ARM Agents. So, to deploy a Microservice running those images, we can use the following YAML:

```bash
echo "---
apiVersion: 'datasance.com/v3'
kind: Application
metadata:
name: edge-guard
spec:
---
apiVersion: 'datasance.com/v3'
kind: Microservice # Or application, as application uses the same spec for its microservices
metadata:
  name: edge-guard
spec:
  agent:
    name: my-agent-name
    config: {}
  images:
    catalogId: 4
  container:
    env: []
    ports: []
    rootHostAccess: false
    volumes:
      - hostDestination: /etc/iofog-agent/local-api
        containerDestination: /local-api
        accessMode: ro
        type: bind
      - hostDestination: hw-id
        containerDestination: /id
        accessMode: rw
        type: volume
    commands: []
  config: {}
  application: edge-guard
" > /tmp/edge-guard.yaml
potctl deploy microservice -f /tmp/edge-guard.yaml
```

Note that this YAML snippet assumes we have a running ECN in the current Namespace with an Agent called `my-agent-name`.

We can check that the expected images have been used by describing our Microservice with potctl:

```bash
potctl describe microservice edge-guard/edge-guard
```


## Create our own Catalog Items

We can also use potctl to create our own Catalog Items. The YAML spec reference can be found [here](../reference-potctl/reference-catalog).

```bash
echo "---
apiVersion: 'datasance.com/v3'
kind: CatalogItem
metadata:
  name: 'my-multiplatform-microservice'
spec:
  description: 'Alpine Linux'
  x86: 'amd64/alpine:latest'
  arm: 'arm32v6/alpine:latest'
  registry: 'remote'

" > /tmp/my-catalog-item.yaml
potctl deploy -f /tmp/my-catalog-item.yaml
```

We can verify that our new Catalog Item was added to the Catalog:

```bash
potctl get catalog | grep my-multiplatform-microservice
```

```plain
17		my-multiplatform-microservice	Alpine Linux											remote		amd64/alpine:latest			arm32v6/alpine:latest
```

We used grep to filter the ouput, but the columns are the same as above. You can now use the `spec.images.catalogId` field on `Microservice` kind set to 17 in order to deploy you microservice.

# Registries

During the [tutorial](../tutorial/introduction), we saw that the images are being pulled from a repository specified in the YAML. The two values we have used so far are `remote` (public docker hub) and `local` (image locally present on the Agent). There is a third value available, which is a `repository ID`.

NB: `remote` and `local` are aliases for values `1` and `2`, which are the repository seeded in your Controller database.

We can list our current registries using `potctl get registries`

```plain
ID              URL                     USERNAME        PRIVATE         SECURE
1               registry.hub.docker.com                 false           true
2               from_cache                              false           true
```

We can add a new registry using the `Registry` [deploy kind](../reference-potctl/reference-registry)

```bash
echo "---
apiVersion: datasance.com/v3
kind: Registry
spec:
  url: registry.hub.docker.com # This will create a registry that can download your private docker hub images
  username: john
  password: q1u45ic9kst563art
  email: user@domain.com
" > /tmp/my-private-registry.yaml
potctl deploy -f /tmp/my-private-registry.yaml
```

After running this, you should now have 3 registries and you can use the `ID` in the [microservice images registry field](../reference-potctl/reference-application)
