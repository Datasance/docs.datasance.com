# Distributed Applications

ioFog is a platform for running distributed applications on Edge Compute Networks. A distributed application is made up of some number of microservices.

We can specify distributed applications in YAML through potctl's [Application kind](../reference-potctl/reference-application). We can then deploy an entire distributed application through potctl by using this specification:

```bash
potctl deploy -f application.yaml
```

We can also deploy individual microservices if we wish. The potctl [Microservice kind](../reference-potctl/reference-application) allows us to do this.

```bash
potctl deploy -f microservice.yaml
```

The rest of this section will cover how we can manage our distributed applications and microservices after we have deployed them.
