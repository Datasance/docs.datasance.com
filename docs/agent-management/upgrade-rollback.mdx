# Agent Upgrade / Rollback

`potctl` provides a means to upgrade your Agents to the latest version and rollback to the previous version following an upgrade.

To upgrade, run the following command:

```bash
potctl upgrade agent agent-1
```

The Agent will spend a few minutes upgrading at this point. If the version doesn't change (e.g. via `potctl get agents`), then it is possible something went wrong. Review the contents of `/var/log/iofog-agent-upgrade.log` to find the output of the upgrade process on the Agent.

To revert the upgrade, run the rollback command:

```bash
potctl rollback agent agent-1
```
