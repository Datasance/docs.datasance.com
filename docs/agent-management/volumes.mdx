# Volume Management

Often our Microservices will require some external data to be mounted into their container environments.

With potctl, we can push directories to our Agents so that they can be mounted into Microservice containers as volumes. To do this, we can specify a Volume in YAML like so:

```yaml
apiVersion: datasance.com/v3
kind: Volume
spec:
  name: secret
  source: /tmp/
  destination: /tmp/secrets/
  permissions: 666
  agents:
    - agent-1
    - agent-2
```

To push the data to our Agents, we run:

```bash
potctl deploy -f volume.yaml
```

With the above example, the `/tmp/` directory and all of its subdirectories will be pushed to `/tmp/secrets/` in `agent-1` and `agent-2`.

Once the Volume has been deployed, we can deploy Microservices that depend on it. The YAML specification for doing this can be found [here](../reference-potctl/reference-application).

Volumes can be listed, described, and deleted like all other potctl resources.
