## EdgeGuard

EdgeGuard is particularly valuable for edge devices deployed outside traditional datacenters, where the risk of unauthorized access is significantly higher. By detecting potential security breaches and wiping all microservices running on the compromised ioFog Agent, EdgeGuard helps organizations adhere to strict security policies and minimize exposure to potential threats

## Kubernetes ControlPlane

The Kubernetes Control Plane in Datasance PoT ensures seamless integration with Kubernetes-native tools and workflows. With enhanced security practices and alignment with enterprise-grade standards, it provides robust control for deploying, managing, and scaling edge compute workloads.

## Keycloak Auth and RBAC

Keycloak is now integrated into the Datasance PoT platform, offering secure authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This ensures enterprise-grade identity management, user roles, and granular access permissions across your Edge Compute Network (ECN).

[Find out more](../platform-iam/introduction)!

## Controller Ingress

The Controller Ingress feature enables secure and customizable access to the `KubernetesControlPlane`. Users can configure ingress settings to route traffic efficiently while adhering to organizational security standards. This includes domain-based routing and SSL/TLS configurations.

Check out the `KubernetesControlPlane` [YAML specification](../reference-potctl/reference-control-plane)!

## Router and Proxy SSL Configurations

With SSL/TLS configurations for the `Router` and `Proxy` components, Datasance PoT ensures encrypted and secure communication between microservices. This feature simplifies compliance with security standards and enhances the integrity of data in transit across the ECN.

Learn more about SSL Configurations from `KubernetesControlPlane` [YAML specification](../reference-potctl/reference-control-plane)!

## Router

The Datasance PoT Router, upgraded from Apache Qpid Dispatch to Skupper Router as Dispatch Router is maintained by RedHat Skupper's community. 
For production workload you need to configure SSL/TLS across cluster. You don't need to manually send  certificates as a volume to your Edge device , `Router` can now gather it's SSL/TLS configuration and base64 encoded SSL/TLS certificates from `Agent` LocalAPI which helps you to easily build trust across Edge Compute Network (ECN).

## WASM Container Support

WebAssemly promising a huge potential for state-of-the art Edge use cases. You can run, deploy and manage  WebAssembly containers alongside with your traditional containers. Folks at containerd/runwasi community building containerd Wasm shims for the most popular WebAssembly runtimes. We are now publishing containerd wasm shims for WasmEdge, Wasmer, and Wasmtime runtimes as  `.deb` `.rpm` packages on our official [Linux Artifact Repository](https://downloads.datasance.com), and it is already included in `Agent` installation script on `potctl`. This expands the platform's capability to deploy lightweight, portable, and efficient applications, unlocking new possibilities for edge computing.

Check out the Microservice [YAML specification](../reference-potctl/reference-application)!

## GPU Workload Management

GPU workload management is now possible through CDI (Container Device Interface) definitions in microservice YAML files. This feature allows developers to assign GPU resources efficiently, enabling high-performance compute tasks such as AI and ML workloads at the edge.

Check out the Microservice [YAML specification](../reference-potctl/reference-application)!

## New Microservice Container Configuration Options

Additional configuration options for microservices include `runAsUser`, `platform`, `runtime`, and `cdiDevices`. These options provide greater flexibility and security, enabling you to tailor deployments to meet specific application requirements.

Check out the Microservice [YAML specification](../reference-potctl/reference-application)!

## NATs Catalog Microservice

The NATs Catalog Microservice offers a scalable and lightweight solution for message streaming and communication within the ECN or Edge2X connectivity with built-in MQTT support comes with NATs. Designed for high-performance, this microservice integrates seamlessly with Datasance PoT’s architecture.

[Check out NATs Catalog Microservice](../reference-microservices-catalog/nats)

## ECN Viewer: System Applications

Each router and proxy microservices are created automatically as a `system` application on each `Agent` . New `applications/system` and `microservices/system` endpoints are avaliable on Controller REST-API. The ECN Viewer’s System Applications tab allows Admins and SREs to manage Router and Proxy microservices, configure SSL/TLS settings, and monitor the their health.

[Find out more!](../reference-controller/ecn-viewer)

## ECN Viewer: Swagger-UI

Built-in Swagger UI integrated into ECN-Viewer. SREs and Developers send request to the `Controller REST-API` via browser.

[Find out more!](../reference-controller/ecn-viewer)

## Template parametric expressions

Variables, filter and template "queries" can now be used as values for any field in your deployment YAMLs (And therefore, any value of the JSON body of most PUT/POST/PATCH Controller REST API requests).

Those variables allow you to reference the same document, or any resource preexisting on your Controller, adding a lot of flexibility in your deployments.

[Find out more](../reference-potctl/reference-template-engine)!

## Application Templates

What if we need to deploy the same code on a lot of Agents? We would need to details all the microservices and routes in a separate YAML document for every instance of your Application. This is tedious and error prone, as often only a few values would change from one Agent to another.

Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to specify the skeleton (template) of an Application and then reuse the same template over an over again, only modifying a few variables? That's where the Controller Application Template catalog comes into play!

[Find out more!](../applications/application-templates) and check out the [YAML specification](../reference-potctl/reference-application-template)!

## Edge Resources

The Edge is where the virtual meets the physical. Most if not all Edge applications are built to interact in some way with entities or resources that exist in the physical world.

Edge Resources are Digital Twins that allow you to define an interface for your microservices to communicate with resources available on your ioFog Agents.

[Find out more!](../agent-management/edge-resources)

## Agent Installation Plugins

`potctl` can install ioFog Agent on a number of Linux distributions out of the box. However, the list of supported distributions is finite; in order to allow the community to add support for any host environment, `potctl` has been updated with the ability to run user-defined installation scripts for Agent and its dependancies.
